# MP3Sync
A terminal application to sync your music library to your MP3 player

This is a simple proof of concept/experiment for me, to see if I can mass convert audio files and sync them to a MP3 Player.

Definitely works on Linux (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS), but Windows may or may not work.

FFMPEG AND MUTAGEN REQUIRED!

A copy of ffmpeg 7.1 for Windows is included with this program, built by [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/#release-builds).

This copy of ffmpeg 7.1 only will be run if the platform is Windows and ffmpeg isn't installed via `winget`, `scoop`, or `choco`. A copy of the source code at time of release is avaliable [here](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/b08d7969c5).
