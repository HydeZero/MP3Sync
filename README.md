# MP3Sync
A terminal application to sync your music library to your MP3 player

This is a simple proof of concept/experiment for me, to see if I can mass convert audio files and sync them to a MP3 Player.

Definitely works on Linux (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS), but Windows may or may not work.

FFMPEG AND MUTAGEN REQUIRED!
